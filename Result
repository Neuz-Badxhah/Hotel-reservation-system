Without more information, I cannot provide a specific result of the code. However, I can describe the expected behavior of the program based on its implementation.

The program is a hotel reservation system that allows users to reserve a room, view existing reservations, cancel reservations, or exit the system. When the program is run, it will display a welcome message and a menu with four options:

Reserve a room
View reservations
Cancel a reservation
Exit
The user can select an option by entering a number from 1 to 4.

If the user selects option 1, they will be prompted to enter the guest name, number of guests, and room number they want to reserve. If the reservation is successful, the program will display a message saying that the reservation was made successfully.

If the user selects option 2, the program will display a list of existing reservations, including the guest name, room number, and number of guests.

If the user selects option 3, they will be prompted to enter the room number for the reservation they want to cancel.

If the user selects option 4, the program will display a thank you message and exit.

The program will continue to display the menu until the user selects option 4 to exit the system.
